# âš› React Next CMS by Adrian

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project ready for authentication, API connectivity, [FontAwesome][fontawesome], and [Tailwind][tailwind] as CSS framework.

**Requirements**

* Node 14.15.5


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
